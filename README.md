# Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a state-of-the-art approach for automatically translating text from one language to another using deep learning models. Unlike traditional machine translation systems, which rely heavily on rule-based methods or statistical models, NMT leverages **neural networks** to achieve higher accuracy and more natural translations.

## What is Neural Machine Translation?

NMT involves training neural network architectures to model the complex relationship between the source language and the target language. The primary goal is to predict the most likely translation of a given input sequence by learning context from large amounts of bilingual data.

### Key Advantages of NMT
- **Improved Translation Quality**: Produces more fluent and context-aware translations compared to traditional methods.
- **End-to-End Training**: The entire system can be trained as a single model, simplifying the translation process.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Capable of capturing long-range dependencies between words and phrases.
- **Adaptability**: Can be adapted to specific language pairs and domains.

## How NMT Works

### 1. **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model**
   - A core architecture in NMT that uses an **encoder-decoder** structure.
   - The **encoder** processes the source language input and compresses it into a fixed-length context vector.
   - The **decoder** generates the target language output from the context vector.

### 2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Traditionally used in Seq2Seq models to handle sequential data.
   - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** are popular RNN variants that address the vanishing gradient problem, enabling better handling of long sentences.

### 3. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Introduced to improve the limitations of the fixed-length context vector in Seq2Seq models.
   - **Attention** allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each step, making it easier to translate long sentences and handle contextual dependencies.
   - **Self-attention** is a type of attention mechanism used in models like **Transformers**, where the model attends to all parts of the input simultaneously.

### 4. **Transformer Architecture**
   - Introduced in the paper **“Attention Is All You Need”** by Vaswani et al. in 2017.
   - The **Transformer model** uses self-attention mechanisms instead of RNNs, enabling parallel processing and faster training.
   - It consists of:
     - **Encoder Layers**: Processes the input sequence.
     - **Decoder Layers**: Generates the output sequence.
